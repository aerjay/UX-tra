#### Background 
UXTRA is a web-application project for Software Engineering 513 class that aims to create a community of UX designers that support one another through reviews and design discussions. Through the application, UX designers can post their own projects so that other designers can review and make suggestions on their designs. UX designers can also use the application to reach out to their target audience. There are two types of UX reviewers: UX designers and UX Enthusiasts. UX designers can gain inspiration and grow in their ability to give constructive criticism to their peers. UX enthusiasts gain from being part of the community by acquiring their desired perks through the credits they receive through the application.

#### Project Goals  
Our aim is to design an application that encourages designers to collaborate with each other and gain feedback from their work. UXTRA needs to be aesthetically pleasing to attract designers and encourage them to post their designs on our application. To make this possible, UX Designers and/or UX Enthusiasts need the ability to create their own personal accounts, post their own projects and view them, view other designer’s projects, and post a review for other designer’s projects.

#### Project Accomplishments
Throughout the Winter 2018 semester, our development team diligently worked towards making UXTRA into a reality. Although not all features mentioned above were implemented, the team was able to accomplish a significant portion of the application given the time constraints. For this version release of UXTRA, users are able to create an account using their email address, log-in to their account, log-out of their account, close the UXTRA window and reopen it without having to log-in again, and post their own projects including a photo and project
